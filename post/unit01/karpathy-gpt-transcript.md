intro: ChatGPT, Transformers, nanoGPT, Shakespeare
0:00
hi everyone so by now you have probably heard of chat GPT it has taken the world and AI Community by storm and it is a
0:07
system that allows you to interact with an AI and give it text based tasks so
0:12
for example we can ask chat GPT to write us a small Hau about how important it is that people understand Ai and then they
0:18
can use it to improve the world and make it more prosperous so when we run this AI knowledge brings prosperity for all
0:25
to see Embrace its power okay not bad and so you could see that chpt went from left to right and
0:32
generated all these words SE sort of sequentially now I asked it already the
0:37
exact same prompt a little bit earlier and it generated a slightly different outcome ai's power to grow ignorance
0:44
holds us back learn Prosperity weights so uh pretty good in both cases and
0:49
slightly different so you can see that chat GPT is a probabilistic system and for any one prompt it can give us
0:54
multiple answers sort of uh replying to it now this is just one example of a
0:59
problem people have come up with many many examples and there are entire websites that index interactions with
1:06
chpt and so many of them are quite humorous explain HTML to me like I'm a dog uh write release notes for chess 2
1:14
write a note about Elon Musk buying a Twitter and so on so as an example uh
1:20
please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree uh and a shocking turn of events a
1:26
leaf has fallen from a tree in the local park Witnesses report that the leaf which was previously attached to a branch of a tree attached itself and
1:33
fell to the ground very dramatic so you can see that this is a pretty remarkable system and it is what we call a language
1:40
model uh because it um it models the sequence of words or characters or
1:46
tokens more generally and it knows how sort of words follow each other in English language and so from its
1:52
perspective what it is doing is it is completing the sequence so I give it the start of a sequence and it completes the
2:00
sequence with the outcome and so it's a language model in that sense now I would
2:05
like to focus on the under the hood of um under the hood components of what makes CH GPT work so what is the neural
2:12
network under the hood that models the sequence of these words and that comes
2:17
from this paper called attention is all you need in 2017 a landmark paper a
2:23
landmark paper in AI that produced and proposed the Transformer architecture so GPT is uh short for
2:31
generally generatively pre-trained Transformer so Transformer is the neuron nut that actually does all the heavy
2:36
lifting under the hood it comes from this paper in 2017 now if you read this paper this uh reads like a pretty random
2:44
machine translation paper and that's because I think the authors didn't fully anticipate the impact that the Transformer would have on the field and
2:51
this architecture that they produced in the context of machine translation in their case actually ended up taking over
2:57
uh the rest of AI in the next 5 years after and so this architecture with
3:02
minor changes was copy pasted into a huge amount of applications in AI in more recent years and that includes at
3:10
the core of chat GPT now we are not going to what I'd like to do now is I'd
3:15
like to build out something like chat GPT but uh we're not going to be able to of course reproduce chat GPT this is a
3:21
very serious production grade system it is trained on uh a good chunk of
3:26
internet and then there's a lot of uh pre-training and fine-tuning stages to it and so it's very complicated what I'd
3:33
like to focus on is just to train a Transformer based language model and in
3:38
our case it's going to be a character level language model I still think that is uh very educational with respect to
3:45
how these systems work so I don't want to train on the chunk of Internet we need a smaller data set in this case I
3:51
propose that we work with uh my favorite toy data set it's called tiny Shakespeare and um what it is is
3:57
basically it's a concatenation of all of the works of sh Shakespeare in my understanding and so this is all of
4:02
Shakespeare in a single file uh this file is about 1 megab and it's just all
4:07
of Shakespeare and what we are going to do now is we're going to basically model how these characters uh follow each
4:14
other so for example given a chunk of these characters like this uh given some
4:19
context of characters in the past the Transformer neural network will look at the characters that I've highlighted and
4:26
is going to predict that g is likely to come next in the sequence and it's going to do that because we're going to train
4:31
that Transformer on Shakespeare and it's just going to try to produce uh character sequences that look like this
4:39
and in that process is going to model all the patterns inside this data so once we've trained the system i' just
4:45
like to give you a preview we can generate infinite Shakespeare and of course it's a fake thing that looks kind
4:51
of like Shakespeare um apologies for there's some Jank that
4:59
I'm not able to resolve in in here but um you can see how this is going
5:05
character by character and it's kind of like predicting Shakespeare like language so verily my Lord the sites
5:12
have left the again the king coming with my curses with precious pale and then
5:19
tranos say something else Etc and this is just coming out of the Transformer in a very similar manner as it would come
5:25
out in chat GPT in our case character by character in chat GPT uh it's coming out
5:31
on the token by token level and tokens are these sort of like little subword pieces so they're not Word level they're
5:36
kind of like word chunk level um and now I've already written
5:43
this entire code uh to train these Transformers um and it is in a GitHub
5:48
repository that you can find and it's called nanog GPT so nanog GPT is a repository that
5:54
you can find in my GitHub and it's a repository for training Transformers um on any given text and what I think is
6:02
interesting about it because there's many ways to train Transformers but this is a very simple implementation so it's just two files of 300 lines of code each
6:10
one file defines the GPT model the Transformer and one file trains it on some given Text data set and here I'm
6:17
showing that if you train it on a open web Text data set which is a fairly large data set of web pages then I
6:22
reproduce the the performance of gpt2 so gpt2 is an early version of open
6:29
AI GPT uh from 2017 if I recall correctly and I've only so far
6:34
reproduced the the smallest 124 million parameter model uh but basically this is just proving that the codebase is
6:39
correctly arranged and I'm able to load the uh neural network weights that openi
6:45
has released later so you can take a look at the finished code here in N GPT
6:50
but what I would like to do in this lecture is I would like to basically uh write this repository from scratch so
6:57
we're going to begin with an empty file and we're we're going to define a Transformer piece by piece we're going
7:03
to train it on the tiny Shakespeare data set and we'll see how we can then uh generate infinite Shakespeare and of
7:10
course this can copy paste to any arbitrary Text data set uh that you like uh but my goal really here is to just
7:16
make you understand and appreciate uh how under the hood chat GPT works and um
7:22
really all that's required is a Proficiency in Python and uh some basic understanding of um calculus and
7:29
statistics and it would help if you also see my previous videos on the same YouTube channel in particular my make more
7:35
series where I um Define smaller and simpler neural network language models
7:42
uh so multi perceptrons and so on it really introduces the language modeling framework and then uh here in this video
7:49
we're going to focus on the Transformer neural network itself okay so I created a new Google collab uh jup notebook here
reading and exploring the data
7:57
and this will allow me to later easily share this code that we're going to develop together uh with you so you can follow along so this will be in a video
8:03
description uh later now here I've just done some preliminaries I downloaded the
8:09
data set the tiny Shakespeare data set at this URL and you can see that it's about a 1 Megabyte file then here I open
8:15
the input.txt file and just read in all the text of the string and we see that we are working with 1 million characters
8:22
roughly and the first 1,000 characters if we just print them out are basically what you would expect this is the first
8:28
1,000 characters of the tiny Shakespeare data set roughly up to here so so far so
8:34
good next we're going to take this text and the text is a sequence of characters in Python so when I call the set
8:41
Constructor on it I'm just going to get the set of all the characters that occur
8:46
in this text and then I call list on that to create a list of those characters instead of just a set so that
8:53
I have an ordering an arbitrary ordering and then I sort that so basically we get
8:59
just all the characters that occur in the entire data set and they're sorted now the number of them is going to be
9:04
our vocabulary size these are the possible elements of our sequences and we see that when I print here the
9:11
characters there's 65 of them in total there's a space character and then all kinds of special characters and then U
9:19
capitals and lowercase letters so that's our vocabulary and that's the sort of like possible uh characters that the
9:25
model can see or emit okay so next we will would like to develop some strategy
tokenization, train/val split
9:31
to tokenize the input text now when people say tokenize they mean convert
9:36
the raw text as a string to some sequence of integers According to some uh notebook According to some vocabulary
9:43
of possible elements so as an example here we are going to be building a character level language model so we're
9:49
simply going to be translating individual characters into integers so let me show you uh a chunk of code that
9:55
sort of does that for us so we're building both the encoder and the decoder and let me just talk through what's
10:01
happening here when we encode an arbitrary text like hi there we're going to receive a
10:08
list of integers that represents that string so for example 46 47 Etc and then
10:14
we also have the reverse mapping so we can take this list and decode it to get
10:20
back the exact same string so it's really just like a translation to integers and back for arbitrary string
10:26
and for us it is done on a character level now the way this was achieved is we just
10:31
iterate over all the characters here and create a lookup table from the character to the integer and vice versa and then
10:38
to encode some string we simply translate all the characters individually and to decode it back we
10:44
use the reverse mapping and concatenate all of it now this is only one of many possible encodings or many possible sort
10:51
of tokenizers and it's a very simple one but there's many other schemas that people have come up with in practice so
10:57
for example Google uses a sentence piece uh so sentence piece will also encode text into um integers but in a
11:05
different schema and using a different vocabulary and sentence piece is a
11:10
subword uh sort of tokenizer and what that means is that um you're not encoding entire words but you're not
11:17
also encoding individual characters it's it's a subword unit level and that's
11:22
usually what's adopted in practice for example also openai has this Library called tick token that uses a bite pair
11:28
encode tokenizer um and that's what GPT uses and you can also just encode words into
11:35
like hell world into a list of integers so as an example I'm using the Tik token
11:40
Library here I'm getting the encoding for gpt2 or that was used for gpt2
11:46
instead of just having 65 possible characters or tokens they have 50,000
11:51
tokens and so when they encode the exact same string High there we only get a
11:57
list of three integers but those integers are not between 0 and 64 they are between Z and 5,
12:05
5,256 so basically you can trade off the code book size and the sequence lengths
12:12
so you can have very long sequences of integers with very small vocabularies or we can have short um sequences of
12:20
integers with very large vocabularies and so typically people use in practice
12:25
these subword encodings but I'd like to keep our token ier very simple so we're using character level tokenizer and that
12:33
means that we have very small code books we have very simple encode and decode functions uh but we do get very long
12:40
sequences as a result but that's the level at which we're going to stick with this lecture because it's the simplest
12:45
thing okay so now that we have an encoder and a decoder effectively a tokenizer we can tokenize the entire
12:51
training set of Shakespeare so here's a chunk of code that does that and I'm going to start to use the pytorch
12:56
library and specifically the torch. tensor from the pytorch library so we're going to take all of the text in tiny
13:03
Shakespeare encode it and then wrap it into a torch. tensor to get the data tensor so here's what the data tensor
13:10
looks like when I look at just the first 1,000 characters or the 1,000 elements of it so we see that we have a massive
13:16
sequence of integers and this sequence of integers here is basically an identical translation of the first
13:22
10,000 characters here so I believe for example that zero is a new line character and maybe one
13:29
one is a space not 100% sure but from now on the entire data set of text is re-represented as just it's just
13:35
stretched out as a single very large uh sequence of integers let me do one more thing before
13:41
we move on here I'd like to separate out our data set into a train and a validation split so in particular we're
13:48
going to take the first 90% of the data set and consider that to be the training data for the Transformer and we're going
13:54
to withhold the last 10% at the end of it to be the validation data and this will help us understand to what extent
14:01
our model is overfitting so we're going to basically hide and keep the validation data on the side because we
14:06
don't want just a perfect memorization of this exact Shakespeare we want a neural network that sort of creates
14:12
Shakespeare like uh text and so it should be fairly likely for it to produce the actual like stowed away uh
14:21
true Shakespeare text um and so we're going to use this to uh get a sense of
14:26
the overfitting okay so now we would like to start plugging these text sequences or integer sequences into the
data loader: batches of chunks of data
14:32
Transformer so that it can train and learn those patterns now the important thing to realize is we're never going to
14:38
actually feed entire text into a Transformer all at once that would be computationally very expensive and
14:44
prohibitive so when we actually train a Transformer on a lot of these data sets we only work with chunks of the data set
14:50
and when we train the Transformer we basically sample random little chunks out of the training set and train on
14:55
just chunks at a time and these chunks have basically some kind of a length and
15:01
some maximum length now the maximum length typically at least in the code I usually write is called block size you
15:08
can you can uh find it under different names like context length or something like that let's start with the block
15:14
size of just eight and let me look at the first train data characters the first block size plus one characters
15:20
I'll explain why plus one in a second so this is the first nine characters in the sequence in the
15:27
training set now what I'd like to point out is that when you sample a chunk of data like this so say the these nine
15:34
characters out of the training set this actually has multiple examples packed into it and uh that's because all of
15:41
these characters follow each other and so what this thing is going to say when
15:47
we plug it into a Transformer is we're going to actually simultaneously train it to make prediction at every one of
15:52
these positions now in the in a chunk of nine characters there's actually eight indiv
15:58
ual examples packed in there so there's the example that when 18 when in the
16:04
context of 18 47 likely comes next in a context of 18 and 47 56 comes next in a
16:12
context of 18 47 56 57 can come next and so on so that's the eight individual
16:18
examples let me actually spell it out with code so here's a chunk of code to
16:24
illustrate X are the inputs to the Transformer it will just be the first block size characters y will be the uh
16:32
next block size characters so it's offset by one and that's because y are the targets for each position in the
16:40
input and then here I'm iterating over all the block size of eight and the context is always all the characters in
16:47
x uh up to T and including T and the target is always the teth character but
16:53
in the targets array y so let me just run this and basically it spells out what I
16:59
said in words uh these are the eight examples hidden in a chunk of nine characters that we uh sampled from the
17:08
training set I want to mention one more thing we train on all the eight examples
17:14
here with context between one all the way up to context of block size and we train on that not just for computational
17:20
reasons because we happen to have the sequence already or something like that it's not just done for efficiency it's
17:26
also done um to make the Transformer Network be used to seeing contexts all
17:32
the way from as little as one all the way to block size and we'd like the transform to be used to seeing
17:38
everything in between and that's going to be useful later during inference because while we're sampling we can
17:43
start the sampling generation with as little as one character of context and the Transformer knows how to predict the
17:49
next character with all the way up to just context of one and so then it can predict everything up to block size and
17:55
after block size we have to start truncating because the Transformer will will never um receive more than block
18:01
size inputs when it's predicting the next character Okay so we've looked at the time dimension of the tensors that are
18:07
going to be feeding into the Transformer there's one more Dimension to care about and that is the batch Dimension and so
18:13
as we're sampling these chunks of text we're going to be actually every time we're going to feed them into a
18:18
Transformer we're going to have many batches of multiple chunks of text that are all like stacked up in a single
18:23
tensor and that's just done for efficiency just so that we can keep the gpus busy uh because they are very good
18:29
at parallel processing of um of data and so we just want to process multiple
18:35
chunks all at the same time but those chunks are processed completely independently they don't talk to each other and so on so let me basically just
18:42
generalize this and introduce a batch Dimension here's a chunk of code let me just run it and then I'm
18:48
going to explain what it does so here because we're going to start sampling random locations in the
18:54
data set to pull chunks from I am setting the seed so that um in the
19:00
random number generator so that the numbers I see here are going to be the same numbers you see later if you try to reproduce this now the batch size here
19:07
is how many independent sequences we are processing every forward backward pass of the
19:12
Transformer the block size as I explained is the maximum context length to make those predictions so let's say B
19:19
size four block size eight and then here's how we get batch for any arbitrary split if the split is a
19:25
training split then we're going to look at train data otherwise at valid data that gives us the data array and then
19:33
when I Generate random positions to grab a chunk out of I actually grab I
19:38
actually generate batch size number of Random offsets so because this is four
19:44
we are ex is going to be a uh four numbers that are randomly generated between zero and Len of data minus block
19:51
size so it's just random offsets into the training set and then X's as I explained are the
19:58
first first block size characters starting at I the Y's are the offset by
20:05
one of that so just add plus one and then we're going to get those chunks for
20:10
every one of integers I INX and use a torch. stack to take all those uh uh
20:17
one-dimensional tensors as we saw here and we're going to um stack them up at
20:24
rows and so they all become a row in a 4x8 tensor
20:29
so here's where I'm printing then when I sample a batch XB and YB the inputs to
20:35
the Transformer now are the input X is the 4x8 tensor four uh rows of eight
20:44
columns and each one of these is a chunk of the training set and then the targets here are in the
20:52
associated array Y and they will come in to the Transformer all the way at the end uh to um create the loss function
20:59
uh so they will give us the correct answer for every single position inside X and then these are the four
21:06
independent rows so spelled out as we did before uh this 4x8 array contains a
21:14
total of 32 examples and they're completely independent as far as the Transformer is
21:20
concerned uh so when the input is 24 the target is 43 or rather 43 here in the Y
21:28
array when the input is 2443 the target is 58 uh when the input is 24 43 58 the
21:34
target is 5 Etc or like when it is a 52 581 the target is
21:40
58 right so you can sort of see this spelled out these are the 32 independent examples packed in to a single batch of
21:48
the input X and then the desired targets are in y and so now this integer tensor
21:57
of um X is going to feed into the Transformer and that Transformer is
22:02
going to simultaneously process all these examples and then look up the correct um integers to predict in every
22:08
one of these positions in the tensor y okay so now that we have our batch of input that we'd like to feed into a
simplest baseline: bigram language model, loss, generation
22:15
Transformer let's start basically feeding this into neural networks now we're going to start off with the
22:20
simplest possible neural network which in the case of language modeling in my opinion is the Byram language model and
22:25
we've covered the Byram language model in my make more series in a lot of depth and so here I'm going to sort of go
22:31
faster and let's just Implement pytorch module directly that implements the byr language
22:36
model so I'm importing the pytorch um NN module uh for
22:43
reproducibility and then here I'm constructing a Byram language model which is a subass of NN
22:48
module and then I'm calling it and I'm passing it the inputs and the targets
22:53
and I'm just printing now when the inputs on targets come here you see that I'm just taking the index uh the inputs
23:00
X here which I rename to idx and I'm just passing them into this token embedding table so it's going on here is
23:07
that here in the Constructor we are creating a token embedding table and it
23:12
is of size vocap size by vocap size and we're using an. embedding which
23:18
is a very thin wrapper around basically a tensor of shape voap size by vocab size and what's happening here is that
23:25
when we pass idx here every single integer in our input is going to refer to this embedding table and it's going
23:32
to pluck out a row of that embedding table corresponding to its index so 24
23:37
here will go into the embedding table and we'll pluck out the 24th row and then 43 will go here and pluck out the
23:44
43d row Etc and then pytorch is going to arrange all of this into a batch by Time
23:50
by channel uh tensor in this case batch is four time is eight and C which is the
23:57
channels is vocab size or 65 and so we're just going to pluck out all those rows arrange them in a b by T by C and
24:05
now we're going to interpret this as the logits which are basically the scores for the next character in the sequence
24:12
and so what's happening here is we are predicting what comes next based on just the individual identity of a single
24:19
token and you can do that because um I mean currently the tokens are not talking to each other and they're not
24:25
seeing any context except for they're just seeing themselves so I'm a f I'm a token number five and then I can
24:32
actually make pretty decent predictions about what comes next just by knowing that I'm token five because some characters uh know um C follow other
24:39
characters in in typical scenarios so we saw a lot of this in a lot more depth in the make more series and here if I just
24:46
run this then we currently get the predictions the scores the lits for
24:53
every one of the 4x8 positions now that we've made predictions about what comes next we'd like to evaluate the loss
24:58
function and so in make more series we saw that a good way to measure a loss or like a quality of the predictions is to
25:05
use the negative log likelihood loss which is also implemented in pytorch under the name cross entropy so what we'
25:12
like to do here is loss is the cross entropy on the predictions and the
25:17
targets and so this measures the quality of the logits with respect to the Targets in other words we have the
25:24
identity of the next character so how well are we predicting the next character based on the lits and
25:30
intuitively the correct um the correct dimension of low jits uh depending on
25:36
whatever the target is should have a very high number and all the other dimensions should be very low number
25:41
right now the issue is that this won't actually this is what we want we want to basically output the logits and the
25:50
loss this is what we want but unfortunately uh this won't actually run
25:55
we get an error message but intuitively we want to uh measure this now when we
26:01
go to the pytorch um cross entropy documentation here um we're trying to
26:08
call the cross entropy in its functional form uh so that means we don't have to create like a module for it but here
26:14
when we go to the documentation you have to look into the details of how pitor expects these inputs and basically the
26:20
issue here is ptor expects if you have multi-dimensional input which we do because we have a b BYT by C tensor then
26:28
it actually really wants the channels to be the second uh Dimension here so if
26:35
you um so basically it wants a b by C BYT instead of a b by T by C and so it's
26:42
just the details of how P torch treats um these kinds of inputs and so we don't
26:49
actually want to deal with that so what we're going to do instead is we need to basically reshape our logits so here's
26:54
what I like to do I like to take basically give names to the dimensions so lit. shape is B BYT by C and unpack
27:01
those numbers and then let's uh say that logits equals lit. View and we want it
27:07
to be a b * c b * T by C so just a two- dimensional
27:12
array right so we're going to take all the we're going to take all of these um
27:18
positions here and we're going to uh stretch them out in a onedimensional sequence and uh preserve the channel
27:25
Dimension as the second dimension so we're just kind of like stretching out the array so it's two- dimensional and in that case it's going
27:31
to better conform to what pytorch uh sort of expects in its Dimensions now we
27:36
have to do the same to targets because currently targets are um of shape B by T
27:44
and we want it to be just B * T so onedimensional now alternatively you
27:49
could always still just do minus one because pytor will guess what this should be if you want to lay it out uh
27:55
but let me just be explicit and say p * t once we've reshaped this it will match the cross entropy case and then we
28:03
should be able to evaluate our loss okay so that R now and we can do
28:10
loss and So currently we see that the loss is 4.87 now because our uh we have 65
28:17
possible vocabulary elements we can actually guess at what the loss should be and in
28:22
particular we covered negative log likelihood in a lot of detail we are expecting log or lawn of um 1 over 65
28:32
and negative of that so we're expecting the loss to be about 4.1 17 but we're
28:37
getting 4.87 and so that's telling us that the initial predictions are not uh super diffuse they've got a little bit
28:43
of entropy and so we're guessing wrong uh so uh yes but actually we're I a we
28:50
are able to evaluate the loss okay so now that we can evaluate the quality of the model on some data we'd like to also
28:57
be able to generate from the model so let's do the generation now I'm going to go again a little bit faster here
29:03
because I covered all this already in previous videos so here's a generate function for the
29:11
model so we take some uh we take the the same kind of input idx here and
29:18
basically this is the current uh context of some characters in a batch in some
29:24
batch so it's also B BYT and the job of generate is to basically take this B BYT
29:30
and extend it to be B BYT + 1 plus 2 plus 3 and so it's just basically it continues the generation in all the
29:36
batch dimensions in the time Dimension So that's its job and it will do that for Max new tokens so you can see here
29:43
on the bottom there's going to be some stuff here but on the bottom whatever is predicted is concatenated on top of the
29:50
previous idx along the First Dimension which is the time Dimension to create a b BYT + one so that becomes a new idx so
29:58
the job of generate is to take a b BYT and make it a b BYT plus 1 plus 2 plus three as many as we want Max new tokens
30:05
so this is the generation from the model now inside the generation what what are we doing we're taking the current
30:11
indices we're getting the predictions so we get uh those are in the low jits and
30:18
then the loss here is going to be ignored because um we're not we're not using that and we have no targets that
30:23
are sort of ground truth targets that we're going to be comparing with then once we get the logits we are only
30:30
focusing on the last step so instead of a b by T by C we're going to pluck out
30:36
the negative-1 the last element in the time Dimension because those are the predictions for what comes next so that
30:42
gives us the logits which we then convert to probabilities via softmax and then we use tor. multinomial to sample
30:49
from those probabilities and we ask pytorch to give us one sample and so idx
30:54
next will become a b by one because in each uh one of the batch Dimensions
31:00
we're going to have a single prediction for what comes next so this num samples equals one will make this be a
31:06
one and then we're going to take those integers that come from the sampling process according to the probability
31:11
distribution given here and those integers got just concatenated on top of the current sort of like running stream
31:17
of integers and this gives us a b BYT + one and then we can return that now one
31:24
thing here is you see how I'm calling self of idx which will end up going to
31:29
the forward function I'm not providing any Targets So currently this would give an error because targets is uh is uh
31:36
sort of like not given so targets has to be optional so targets is none by default and then if targets is none then
31:44
there's no loss to create so it's just loss is none but else all of this
31:50
happens and we can create a loss so this will make it so um if we have the
31:56
targets we provide them and get a loss if we have no targets it will'll just get the loits so this here will generate from
32:02
the model um and let's take that for a ride
32:08
now oops so I have another code chunk here which will generate for the model
32:13
from the model and okay this is kind of crazy so maybe let me let me break this down so these are the idx
32:23
right I'm creating a batch will be just one time will be just one so I'm
32:30
creating a little one by one tensor and it's holding a zero and the D type the
32:35
data type is uh integer so zero is going to be how we kick off the generation and
32:40
remember that zero is uh is the element standing for a new line character so
32:45
it's kind of like a reasonable thing to to feed in as the very first character in a sequence to be the new
32:51
line um so it's going to be idx which we're going to feed in here then we're going to ask for 100 tokens
32:58
and then. generate will continue that now because uh generate works on the
33:05
level of batches we we then have to index into the zero throw to basically unplug the um the single batch Dimension
33:13
that exists and then that gives us a um
33:18
time steps just a onedimensional array of all the indices which we will convert to simple python list from pytorch
33:26
tensor so that that can feed into our decode function and uh convert those
33:32
integers into text so let me bring this back and we're generating 100 tokens let's
33:37
run and uh here's the generation that we achieved so obviously it's garbage and
33:43
the reason it's garbage is because this is a totally random model so next up we're going to want to train this model
33:49
now one more thing I wanted to point out here is this function is written to be General but it's kind of like ridiculous
33:55
right now because we're feeding in all this we're building out this context and we're concatenating
34:02
it all and we're always feeding it all into the model but that's kind of
34:07
ridiculous because this is just a simple Byram model so to make for example this prediction about K we only needed this W
34:14
but actually what we fed into the model is we fed the entire sequence and then we only looked at the very last piece
34:20
and predicted K so the only reason I'm writing it in this way is because right now this is a byr model but I'd like to
34:27
keep keep this function fixed and I'd like it to work um later when our
34:32
characters actually um basically look further in the history and so right now
34:37
the history is not used so this looks silly uh but eventually the history will be used and so that's why we want to uh
34:44
do it this way so just a quick comment on that so now we see that this is um random so let's train the model so it
34:51
becomes a bit less random okay let's Now train the model so first what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a pyour
training the bigram model
34:57
optimization object so here we are using the optimizer ATM W um now in a make
35:05
more series we've only ever use tastic gradi in descent the simplest possible Optimizer which you can get using the
35:10
SGD instead but I want to use Adam which is a much more advanced and popular Optimizer and it works extremely well
35:16
for uh typical good setting for the learning rate is roughly 3 E4 uh but for
35:22
very very small networks like is the case here you can get away with much much higher learning rates R3 or even
35:28
higher probably but let me create the optimizer object which will basically take the gradients and uh update the
35:35
parameters using the gradients and then here our batch size
35:40
up above was only four so let me actually use something bigger let's say 32 and then for some number of steps um
35:46
we are sampling a new batch of data we're evaluating the loss uh we're zeroing out all the gradients from the
35:52
previous step getting the gradients for all the parameters and then using those gradients to up update our parameters so
35:58
typical training loop as we saw in the make more series so let me now uh run
36:04
this for say 100 iterations and let's see what kind of losses we're going to
36:09
get so we started around 4.7 and now we're getting to down to like 4.6 4.5 Etc so the optimization is
36:18
definitely happening but um let's uh sort of try to increase number of
36:23
iterations and only print at the end because we probably want train for
36:29
longer okay so we're down to 3.6
36:34
roughly roughly down to
36:40
three this is the most janky
36:46
optimization okay it's working let's just do 10,000 and then from here we want to
36:53
copy this and hopefully that we're going to get something reason and of course it's not going to be Shakespeare from a
37:00
byr model but at least we see that the loss is improving and uh hopefully we're
37:05
expecting something a bit more reasonable okay so we're down at about 2.5 is let's see what we get okay
37:12
dramatic improvements certainly on what we had here so let me just increase the number of tokens okay so we see that
37:19
we're starting to get something at least like reasonable is
37:25
um certainly not shakes spear but uh the model is making progress so that is the
37:31
simplest possible model so now what I'd like to do
37:36
is obviously this is a very simple model because the tokens are not talking to each other so given the previous context
37:43
of whatever was generated we're only looking at the very last character to make the predictions about what comes next so now these uh now these tokens
37:50
have to start talking to each other and figuring out what is in the context so that they can make better predictions
37:56
for what comes next and this is how we're going to kick off the uh Transformer okay so next I took the code
port our code to a script
38:02
that we developed in this juper notebook and I converted it to be a script and I'm doing this because I just want to
38:08
simplify our intermediate work into just the final product that we have at this point so in the top here I put all the
38:15
hyp parameters that we to find I introduced a few and I'm going to speak to that in a little bit otherwise a lot
38:20
of this should be recognizable uh reproducibility read data get the encoder and the decoder create the train
38:27
into splits uh use the uh kind of like data loader um that gets a batch of the
38:34
inputs and Targets this is new and I'll talk about it in a second now this is
38:39
the Byram language model that we developed and it can forward and give us a logits and loss and it can
38:45
generate and then here we are creating the optimizer and this is the training
38:51
Loop so everything here should look pretty familiar now some of the small things that I added number one I added
38:57
the ability to run on a GPU if you have it so if you have a GPU then you can this will use Cuda instead of just CPU
39:04
and everything will be a lot more faster now when device becomes Cuda then we need to make sure that when we load the
39:11
data we move it to device when we create the model we want to move uh the model parameters to
39:18
device so as an example here we have the N an embedding table and it's got a
39:23
weight inside it which stores the uh sort of lookup table so so that would be moved to the GPU so that all the
39:29
calculations here happen on the GPU and they can be a lot faster and then finally here when I'm creating the
39:35
context that feeds in to generate I have to make sure that I create it on the device number two what I introduced is
39:43
uh the fact that here in the training Loop here I was just printing the um l.
39:50
item inside the training Loop but this is a very noisy measurement of the current loss because every batch will be
39:56
more or less lucky and so what I want to do usually um is uh I have an estimate
40:02
loss function and the estimate loss basically then um goes up here and it
40:10
averages up the loss over multiple batches so in particular we're going to iterate eval iter times and we're going
40:17
to basically get our loss and then we're going to get the average loss for both splits and so this will be a lot less
40:24
noisy so here when we call the estimate loss we're we're going to report the uh pretty accurate train and validation
40:31
loss now when we come back up you'll notice a few things here I'm setting the model to evaluation phase and down here
40:38
I'm resetting it back to training phase now right now for our model as is this doesn't actually do anything because the
40:44
only thing inside this model is this uh nn. embedding and um this this um
40:51
Network would behave both would behave the same in both evaluation mode and training mode we have no drop off layers
40:57
we have no batm layers Etc but it is a good practice to Think Through what mode your neural network is in because some
41:04
layers will have different Behavior Uh at inference time or training time and
41:11
there's also this context manager torch up nograd and this is just telling pytorch that everything that happens
41:16
inside this function we will not call do backward on and so pytorch can be a lot
41:21
more efficient with its memory use because it doesn't have to store all the intermediate variables uh because we're
41:27
never going to call backward and so it can it can be a lot more memory efficient in that way so also a good
41:32
practice to tpy torch when we don't intend to do back propagation so right now this script is
41:39
about 120 lines of code of and that's kind of our starter code I'm calling it
41:45
b.p and I'm going to release it later now running this script gives us output in the terminal
41:52
and it looks something like this it basically as I ran this code uh it was
41:57
giving me the train loss and Val loss and we see that we convert to somewhere around 2.5 with the pyr model and then here's
42:04
the sample that we produced at the end and so we have everything packaged up in the script and we're in a good
42:11
position now to iterate on this okay so we are almost ready to start writing our very first self attention block for
version 1: averaging past context with for loops, the weakest form of aggregation
42:18
processing these uh tokens now before we actually get there I want to get you
42:24
used to a mathematical trick that is used in the self attention inside a Transformer and is really just like at
42:30
the heart of an an efficient implementation of self attention and so I want to work with this toy example to
42:36
just get you used to this operation and then it's going to make it much more clear once we actually get to um to it
42:43
uh in the script again so let's create a b BYT by C where BT and C are just 48 and two in the toy
42:50
example and these are basically channels and we have uh batches and we have the
42:55
time component and we have information at each point in the sequence so
43:01
see now what we would like to do is we would like these um tokens so we have up
43:06
to eight tokens here in a batch and these eight tokens are currently not talking to each other and we would like
43:11
them to talk to each other we'd like to couple them and in particular we don't
43:17
we we want to couple them in a very specific way so the token for example at the fifth location it should not
43:23
communicate with tokens in the sixth seventh and eighth location because uh those are future tokens in
43:29
the sequence the token on the fifth location should only talk to the one in the fourth third second and first so
43:36
it's only so information only flows from previous context to the current time step and we cannot get any information
43:42
from the future because we are about to try to predict the future so what is the easiest way for
43:49
tokens to communicate okay the easiest way I would say is okay if we're up to
43:54
if we're a fifth token and I'd like to communicate with my past the simplest way we can do that is to just do a
44:00
weight is to just do an average of all the um of all the preceding elements so
44:06
for example if I'm the fif token I would like to take the channels uh that make up that are information at my step but
44:13
then also the channels from the fourth step third step second step and the first step I'd like to average those up
44:19
and then that would become sort of like a feature Vector that summarizes me in the context of my history now of course
44:26
just doing a sum or like an average is an extremely weak form of interaction like this communication is uh extremely
44:32
lossy we've lost a ton of information about the spatial Arrangements of all those tokens uh but that's okay for now
44:38
we'll see how we can bring that information back later for now what we would like to do is for every single
44:43
batch element independently for every teeth token in that sequence we'd like
44:49
to now calculate the average of all the vectors in all the previous tokens and
44:55
also at this token so let's write that out um I have a small snippet here and
45:01
instead of just fumbling around let me just copy paste it and talk to it so in other words we're going to
45:08
create X and B is short for bag of words because bag of words is um is kind of
45:15
like um a term that people use when you are just averaging up things so this is just a bag of words basically there's a
45:21
word stored on every one of these eight locations and we're doing a bag of words we're just averaging
45:27
so in the beginning we're going to say that it's just initialized at Zero and then I'm doing a for Loop here so we're not being efficient yet that's coming
45:34
but for now we're just iterating over all the batch Dimensions independently iterating over time and then the
45:40
previous uh tokens are at this uh batch Dimension and then everything up to and
45:47
including the teeth token okay so when we slice out X in this way X prev
45:54
Becomes of shape um how many T elements there were in the past and then of
46:00
course C so all the two-dimensional information from these little tokens so
46:05
that's the previous uh sort of chunk of um tokens from my current sequence and
46:12
then I'm just doing the average or the mean over the zero Dimension so I'm averaging out the time here and I'm just
46:19
going to get a little c one dimensional Vector which I'm going to store in X bag of words so I can run this and and uh
46:27
this is not going to be very informative because let's see so this is X of Zer so
46:32
this is the zeroth batch element and then expo at zero now you see how the at
46:40
the first location here you see that the two are equal and that's because it's we're just doing an average of this one
46:46
token but here this one is now an average of these two and now this one is
46:53
an average of these three and so on so uh and this last one is the average
47:01
of all of these elements so vertical average just averaging up all the tokens now gives this outcome
47:07
here so this is all well and good uh but this is very inefficient now the trick
the trick in self-attention: matrix multiply as weighted aggregation
47:12
is that we can be very very efficient about doing this using matrix multiplication so that's the
47:18
mathematical trick and let me show you what I mean let's work with the toy example here let me run it and I'll
47:24
explain I have a simple Matrix here that is a 3X3 of all ones a matrix B of just
47:31
random numbers and it's a 3x2 and a matrix C which will be 3x3 multip 3x2
47:36
which will give out a 3x2 so here we're just using um matrix multiplication so a
47:43
multiply B gives us C okay so how are these numbers in C um
47:51
achieved right so this number in the top left is the first row of a dot product
47:57
with the First Column of B and since all the the row of a right now is all just
48:02
ones then the do product here with with this column of B is just going to do a sum of these of this column so 2 + 6 + 6
48:11
is 14 the element here in the output of C is also the first column here the first
48:17
row of a multiplied now with the second column of B so 7 + 4 + 5 is 16 now you
48:25
see that there's repeating elements here so this 14 again is because this row is again all ones and it's multiplying the
48:30
First Column of B so we get 14 and this one is and so on so this last number
48:35
here is the last row do product last column now the trick here is uh the
48:42
following this is just a boring number of um it's just a boring array of all
48:48
ones but torch has this function called Trail which is short for a
48:54
triangular uh something like that and you can wrap it in torch up once and it will just return the lower triangular
49:00
portion of this okay so now it will basically zero out
49:06
uh these guys here so we just get the lower triangular part well what happens if we do
49:14
that so now we'll have a like this and B like this and now what are we getting here in C well what is this number well
49:22
this is the first row times the First Column and because this is zeros
49:28
uh these elements here are now ignored so we just get a two and then this number here is the first row times the
49:35
second column and because these are zeros they get ignored and it's just seven this seven multiplies this one but
49:42
look what happened here because this is one and then zeros we what ended up happening is we're just plucking out the
49:48
row of this row of B and that's what we got now here we have one 1 Z so here 110
49:57
do product with these two columns will now give us 2 + 6 which is 8 and 7 + 4 which is 11 and because this is 111 we
50:05
ended up with the addition of all of them and so basically depending on how many ones and zeros we have here we are
50:12
basically doing a sum currently of a variable number of these rows and that
50:18
gets deposited into C So currently we're doing sums because these are ones but we can also do
50:25
average right and you can start to see how we could do average uh of the rows of B uh sort of in an incremental
50:32
fashion because we don't have to we can basically normalize these rows so that they sum to one and then we're going to
50:39
get an average so if we took a and then we did aals aide torch. sum in the um of a in the um
50:51
oneth Dimension and then let's keep them as true so so therefore the broadcasting
50:57
will work out so if I rerun this you see now that these rows now sum to one so
51:04
this row is one this row is 0. 5.5 Z and here we get 1/3 and now when we do a
51:09
multiply B what are we getting here we are just getting the first row first row
51:15
here now we are getting the average of the first two rows okay so 2 and six average is four
51:23
and four and seven average is 5.5 and on the bottom here we are now getting the average of these three rows
51:31
so the average of all of elements of B are now deposited here and so you can
51:36
see that by manipulating these uh elements of this multiplying Matrix and
51:42
then multiplying it with any given Matrix we can do these averages in this
51:47
incremental fashion because we just get um and we can manipulate that based on
51:53
the elements of a okay so that's very convenient so let's let's swing back up here and see how we can vectorize this
version 2: using matrix multiply
51:59
and make it much more efficient using what we've learned so in particular we are going to produce an
52:05
array a but here I'm going to call it we short for weights but this is our
52:11
a and this is how much of every row we want to average up and it's going to be
52:17
an average because you can see that these rows sum to one so this is our a and then our B in
52:23
this example of course is X so what's going to happen here now is
52:29
that we are going to have an expo 2 and this Expo 2 is going to be way
52:36
multiplying RX so let's think this true way is T BYT
52:42
and this is Matrix multiplying in pytorch a b by T by C and it's giving us uh different what
52:50
shape so pytorch will come here and it will see that these shapes are not the same so it will create a batch Dimension
52:57
here and this is a batched matrix multiply and so it will apply this matrix multiplication in all the batch
53:04
elements um in parallel and individually and then for each batch element there
53:09
will be a t BYT multiplying T by C exactly as we had
53:15
below so this will now create B by T by C and Expo 2 will now become identical
53:24
to Expo so we can see that torch. all close of
53:32
xbo and xbo 2 should be true now so this kind of like convinces us
53:38
that uh these are in fact um the same so xbo and xbo 2 if I just print
53:47
them uh okay we're not going to be able to okay we're not going to be able to just stare it down but
53:54
um well let me try Expo basically just at the zeroth element and Expo two at the zeroth element so just the first
53:59
batch and we should see that this and that should be identical which they are right so what happened here the
54:07
trick is we were able to use batched Matrix multiply to do this uh
54:12
aggregation really and it's a weighted aggregation and the weights are specified in this um T BYT array and
54:21
we're basically doing weighted sums and uh these weighted sums are are U according to uh the weights inside here
54:28
they take on sort of this triangular form and so that means that a token at the teth dimension will only get uh sort
54:36
of um information from the um tokens perceiving it so that's exactly what we
54:41
want and finally I would like to rewrite it in one more way and we're going to see why that's useful so this is the
version 3: adding softmax
54:48
third version and it's also identical to the first and second but let me talk through it it uses
54:54
softmax so Trill here is this Matrix
55:00
lower triangular ones way begins as all
55:05
zero okay so if I just print way in the beginning it's all zero then I
55:11
used masked fill so what this is doing is we. masked fill it's all zeros and
55:18
I'm saying for all the elements where Trill is equal equal Z make them be
55:23
negative Infinity so all the elements where Trill is zero will become negative Infinity now so this is what we get and
55:32
then the final line here is softmax so if I take a softmax along
55:38
every single so dim is negative one so along every single row if I do softmax
55:44
what is that going to do well softmax is um is also like a
55:51
normalization operation right and so spoiler alert you get the exact same
55:58
Matrix let me bring back to softmax and recall that in softmax we're going to exponentiate every single one
56:04
of these and then we're going to divide by the sum and so if we exponentiate
56:10
every single element here we're going to get a one and here we're going to get uh basically zero 0 z0 Z everywhere else
56:17
and then when we normalize we just get one here we're going to get one one and then zeros and then softmax will again
56:24
divide and this will give us 5.5 and so on and so this is also the uh the same
56:30
way to produce uh this mask now the reason that this is a bit more interesting and the reason we're going
56:36
to end up using it in self attention is that these weights here
56:41
begin uh with zero and you can think of this as like an interaction strength or like an affinity so basically it's
56:49
telling us how much of each uh token from the past do we want to Aggregate
56:54
and average up and then this line is saying tokens from
56:59
the past cannot communicate by setting them to negative Infinity we're saying that we will not aggregate anything from
57:06
those tokens and so basically this then goes through softmax and through the weighted
57:11
and this is the aggregation through matrix multiplication and so what this is now is you can think of these as um these
57:19
zeros are currently just set by us to be zero but a quick preview is that these
57:25
affinities between the tokens are not going to be just constant at zero they're going to be data dependent these
57:31
tokens are going to start looking at each other and some tokens will find other tokens more or less interesting
57:37
and depending on what their values are they're going to find each other interesting to different amounts and I'm
57:42
going to call those affinities I think and then here we are saying the future cannot communicate with the past we're
57:49
we're going to clamp them and then when we normalize and sum we're going to aggregate uh sort of their values
57:56
depending on how interesting they find each other and so that's the preview for self attention and basically long story
58:03
short from this entire section is that you can do weighted aggregations of your past
58:08
Elements by having by using matrix multiplication of a lower triangular
58:14
fashion and then the elements here in the lower triangular part are telling you how much of each element uh fuses
58:21
into this position so we're going to use this trick now to develop the self attention block block so first let's get
minor code cleanup
58:27
some quick preliminaries out of the way first the thing I'm kind of bothered by is that you see how we're passing in
58:33
vocap size into the Constructor there's no need to do that because vocap size is already defined uh up top as a global
58:38
variable so there's no need to pass this stuff around next what I want to do is I don't
58:44
want to actually create I want to create like a level of indirection here where we don't directly go to the embedding
58:49
for the um logits but instead we go through this intermediate phase because we're going to start making that bigger
58:57
so let me introduce a new variable n embed it shorted for number of embedding
59:02
Dimensions so nbed here will be say 32 that was a
59:09
suggestion from GitHub co-pilot by the way um it also suest 32 which is a good number so this is an embedding table and
59:16
only 32 dimensional embeddings so then here this is not going to give us logits directly instead
59:23
this is going to give us token embeddings that's I'm going to call it and then to go from the token Tings to
59:29
the logits we're going to need a linear layer so self. LM head let's call it
59:34
short for language modeling head is n and linear from n ined up to vocap size
59:39
and then when we swing over here we're actually going to get the loits by exactly what the co-pilot says now we
59:46
have to be careful here because this C and this C are not equal um this is nmed
59:52
C and this is vocap size so let's just say that n ined is equal to
59:57
C and then this just creates one spous layer of interaction through a linear layer but uh this should basically
1:00:11
run so we see that this runs and uh this currently looks kind of spous but uh
1:00:17
we're going to build on top of this now next up so far we've taken these indices
positional encoding
1:00:22
and we've encoded them based on the identity of the uh tokens in inside idx
1:00:28
the next thing that people very often do is that we're not just encoding the identity of these tokens but also their
1:00:33
position so we're going to have a second position uh embedding table here so self. position embedding table is an an
1:00:41
embedding of block size by an embed and so each position from zero to block size minus one will also get its own
1:00:47
embedding vector and then here first let me decode B BYT from idx do
1:00:54
shape and then here we're also going to have a pause embedding which is the positional embedding and these are this
1:01:00
is to arrange so this will be basically just integers from Z to T minus one and
1:01:06
all of those integers from 0 to T minus one get embedded through the table to create a t by
1:01:11
C and then here this gets renamed to just say x and x will be the addition of
1:01:18
the token embeddings with the positional embeddings and here the broadcasting note will work out so B by T by C plus T
1:01:25
by C this gets right aligned a new dimension of one gets added and it gets broadcasted across
1:01:31
batch so at this point x holds not just the token identities but the positions
1:01:37
at which these tokens occur and this is currently not that useful because of course we just have a simple byr model
1:01:43
so it doesn't matter if you're in the fifth position the second position or wherever it's all translation invariant at this stage uh so this information
1:01:50
currently wouldn't help uh but as we work on the self attention block we'll see that this starts to matter
1:01:59
okay so now we get the Crux of self attention so this is probably the most important part of this video to
THE CRUX OF THE VIDEO: version 4: self-attention
1:02:05
understand we're going to implement a small self attention for a single individual head as they're called so we
1:02:11
start off with where we were so all of this code is familiar so right now I'm
1:02:16
working with an example where I Chang the number of channels from 2 to 32 so we have a 4x8 arrangement of tokens and
1:02:24
each to and the information each token is currently 32 dimensional but we just are working with random
1:02:30
numbers now we saw here that the code as we had it before does a uh simple weight
1:02:37
simple average of all the past tokens and the current token so it's just the
1:02:43
previous information and current information is just being mixed together in an average and that's what this code currently achieves and it Doo by
1:02:50
creating this lower triangular structure which allows us to mask out this uh we
1:02:55
uh Matrix that we create so we mask it out and then we normalize it and
1:03:01
currently when we initialize the affinities between all the different sort of tokens or nodes I'm going to use
1:03:08
those terms interchangeably so when we initialize the affinities between all the different tokens to be zero then we see that way
1:03:16
gives us this um structure where every single row has these um uniform numbers
1:03:22
and so that's what that's what then uh in this Matrix multiply makes it so that we're doing a simple
1:03:28
average now we don't actually want this to be all uniform because different uh
1:03:36
tokens will find different other tokens more or less interesting and we want that to be data dependent so for example
1:03:42
if I'm a vowel then maybe I'm looking for consonants in my past and maybe I want to know what those consonants are
1:03:48
and I want that information to flow to me and so I want to now gather information from the past but I want to
1:03:54
do it in the data dependent way and this is the problem that self attention solves now the way self attention solves
1:04:00
this is the following every single node or every single token at each position
1:04:06
will emit two vectors it will emit a query and it will emit a
1:04:12
key now the query Vector roughly speaking is what am I looking for and
1:04:18
the key Vector roughly speaking is what do I contain and then the way we get
1:04:24
affinities between these uh tokens now in a sequence is we basically just do a
1:04:29
do product between the keys and the queries so my query dot products with
1:04:35
all the keys of all the other tokens and that dot product now becomes
1:04:41
wayy and so um if the key and the query are sort of aligned they will interact
1:04:47
to a very high amount and then I will get to learn more about that specific token as opposed to any other token in
1:04:55
the sequence so let's implement this
1:05:00
now we're going to implement a single what's called head of self
1:05:07
attention so this is just one head there's a hyper parameter involved with these heads which is the head size and
1:05:13
then here I'm initializing linear modules and I'm using bias equals false so these are just going to apply a
1:05:19
matrix multiply with some fixed weights and now let me produce a key and
1:05:26
q k and Q by forwarding these modules on X so the size of this will now
1:05:32
become B by T by 16 because that is the head size and the same here B by T by
1:05:44
16 so this being the head size so you see here that when I forward this linear
1:05:49
on top of my X all the tokens in all the positions in the B BYT Arrangement all
1:05:55
of them them in parallel and independently produce a key and a query so no communication has happened
1:06:01
yet but the communication comes now all the queries will do product with all the
1:06:07
keys so basically what we want is we want way now or the affinities between these to be query multiplying key but we
1:06:16
have to be careful with uh we can't Matrix multiply this we actually need to transpose uh K but we have to be also
1:06:23
careful because these are when you have The Bash Dimension so in particular we want to transpose uh the last two
1:06:30
dimensions dimension1 and dimension -2 so
1:06:36
-21 and so this Matrix multiply now will basically do the following B by T by
1:06:44
16 Matrix multiplies B by 16 by T to give us B by T by
1:06:53
T right so for every row of B we're now going to
1:06:58
have a t Square Matrix giving us the affinities and these are now the way so
1:07:04
they're not zeros they are now coming from this dot product between the keys and the queries so this can now run I
1:07:11
can I can run this and the weighted aggregation now is a function in a data
1:07:16
Bandon manner between the keys and queries of these nodes so just inspecting what happened
1:07:22
here the way takes on this form and you see that before way was uh just
1:07:29
a constant so it was applied in the same way to all the batch elements but now every single batch elements will have
1:07:34
different sort of we because uh every single batch element contains different uh tokens at different positions and so
1:07:41
this is not data dependent so when we look at just the zeroth uh Row for
1:07:47
example in the input these are the weights that came out and so you can see now that they're not just exactly
1:07:53
uniform um and in particular as an example here for the last row this was the eighth token and the eighth token
1:08:00
knows what content it has and it knows at what position it's in and now the E token based on that uh creates a query
1:08:08
hey I'm looking for this kind of stuff um I'm a vowel I'm on the E position I'm looking for any consonant at positions
1:08:14
up to four and then all the nodes get to emit keys and maybe one of the channels
1:08:20
could be I am a I am a consonant and I am in a position up to four and that that key would have a high number in
1:08:27
that specific Channel and that's how the query and the key when they do product they can find each other and create a
1:08:33
high affinity and when they have a high Affinity like say uh this token was
1:08:38
pretty interesting to uh to this eighth token when they have a high Affinity
1:08:43
then through the softmax I will end up aggregating a lot of its information into my position and so I'll get to
1:08:49
learn a lot about it now just this we're looking at way
1:08:55
after this has already happened um let me erase this operation as well so let
1:09:01
me erase the masking and the softmax just to show you the under the hood internals and how that works so without
1:09:07
the masking in the softmax Whey comes out like this right this is the outputs of the do products um and these are the
1:09:14
raw outputs and they take on values from negative you know two to positive two Etc so that's the raw interactions and
1:09:21
raw affinities between all the nodes but now if I'm going if I'm a fifth node I will not want to aggregate anything from
1:09:28
the sixth node seventh node and the eighth node so actually we use the upper triangular masking so those are not
1:09:35
allowed to communicate and now we actually want to have a nice uh distribution uh so we
1:09:42
don't want to aggregate negative .11 of this node that's crazy so instead we exponentiate and normalize and now we
1:09:49
get a nice distribution that sums to one and this is telling us now in the data dependent manner how much of information
1:09:54
to aggregate from any of these tokens in the past so that's way and it's not zeros
1:10:01
anymore but but it's calculated in this way now there's one more uh part to a
1:10:08
single self attention head and that is that when we do the aggregation we don't actually aggregate the tokens exactly we
1:10:15
aggregate we produce one more value here and we call that the
1:10:20
value so in the same way that we produced p and query we're also going to create a value
1:10:26
and then here we don't aggregate X we calculate a v which is
1:10:34
just achieved by uh propagating this linear on top of X again and then we
1:10:40
output way multiplied by V so V is the elements that we aggregate or the the
1:10:46
vectors that we aggregate instead of the raw X and now of course uh this will make it
1:10:51
so that the output here of this single head will be 16 dimensional because that is the head
1:10:57
size so you can think of X as kind of like private information to this token if you if you think about it that way so
1:11:03
X is kind of private to this token so I'm a fifth token at some and I have some identity and uh my information is
1:11:11
kept in Vector X and now for the purposes of the single head here's what I'm interested in here's what I have and
1:11:20
if you find me interesting here's what I will communicate to you and that's stored in v and so V is the thing that
1:11:26
gets aggregated for the purposes of this single head between the different notes and that's uh basically the self
1:11:34
attention mechanism this is this is what it does there are a few notes that I would make like to make about attention
note 1: attention as communication
1:11:41
number one attention is a communication mechanism you can really think about it as a communication mechanism where you
1:11:48
have a number of nodes in a directed graph where basically you have edges pointed between noes like
1:11:53
this and what happens is every node has some Vector of information and it gets to aggregate information via a weighted
1:12:01
sum from all of the nodes that point to it and this is done in a data dependent manner so depending on whatever data is
1:12:08
actually stored that you should not at any point in time now our graph doesn't
1:12:13
look like this our graph has a different structure we have eight nodes because the block size is eight and there's
1:12:18
always eight to tokens and uh the first node is only pointed to by itself the second node is
1:12:25
pointed to by the first node and itself all the way up to the eighth node which is pointed to by all the previous nodes
1:12:32
and itself and so that's the structure that our directed graph has or happens happens to have in Auto regressive sort
1:12:38
of scenario like language modeling but in principle attention can be applied to any arbitrary directed graph and it's
1:12:44
just a communication mechanism between the nodes the second note is that notice that there is no notion of space so
note 2: attention has no notion of space, operates over sets
1:12:51
attention simply acts over like a set of vectors in this graph and so by default
1:12:56
these nodes have no idea where they are positioned in the space and that's why we need to encode them positionally and
1:13:02
sort of give them some information that is anchored to a specific position so that they sort of know where they are
1:13:08
and this is different than for example from convolution because if you're run for example a convolution operation over some input there's a very specific sort
1:13:15
of layout of the information in space and the convolutional filters sort of act in space and so it's it's not like
1:13:23
an attention in ATT ention is just a set of vectors out there in space they communicate and if you want them to have
1:13:29
a notion of space you need to specifically add it which is what we've done when we calculated the um relative
1:13:36
the positional encode encodings and added that information to the vectors the next thing that I hope is very clear
note 3: there is no communication across batch dimension
1:13:41
is that the elements across the batch Dimension which are independent examples never talk to each other they're always
1:13:47
processed independently and this is a batched matrix multiply that applies basically a matrix multiplication uh
1:13:53
kind of in parallel across the batch dimension so maybe it would be more accurate to say that in this analogy of
1:13:58
a directed graph we really have because the back size is four we really have four separate pools of eight nodes and
1:14:05
those eight nodes only talk to each other but in total there's like 32 nodes that are being processed uh but there's
1:14:11
um sort of four separate pools of eight you can look at it that way the next note is that here in the case of
note 4: encoder blocks vs. decoder blocks
1:14:18
language modeling uh we have this specific uh structure of directed graph where the future tokens will not
1:14:24
communicate to the Past tokens but this doesn't necessarily have to be the constraint in the general case and in
1:14:30
fact in many cases you may want to have all of the uh noes talk to each other uh fully so as an example if you're doing
1:14:37
sentiment analysis or something like that with a Transformer you might have a number of tokens and you may want to
1:14:42
have them all talk to each other fully because later you are predicting for example the sentiment of the sentence
1:14:49
and so it's okay for these NOS to talk to each other and so in those cases you will use an encoder block of self
1:14:55
attention and uh all it means that it's an encoder block is that you will delete this line of code allowing all the noes
1:15:02
to completely talk to each other what we're implementing here is sometimes called a decoder block and it's called a
1:15:09
decoder because it is sort of like a decoding language and it's got this
1:15:15
autor regressive format where you have to mask with the Triangular Matrix so that uh nodes from the future never talk
1:15:22
to the Past because they would give away the answer and so basically in encoder blocks you
1:15:27
would delete this allow all the noes to talk in decoder blocks this will always be present so that you have this
1:15:33
triangular structure uh but both are allowed and attention doesn't care attention supports arbitrary connectivity between nodes the next
note 5: attention vs. self-attention vs. cross-attention
1:15:40
thing I wanted to comment on is you keep me you keep hearing me say attention self attention Etc there's actually also
1:15:45
something called cross attention what is the difference so basically the reason this attention
1:15:52
is self attention is because because the keys queries and the values are all
1:15:57
coming from the same Source from X so the same Source X produces Keys queries
1:16:03
and values so these nodes are self attending but in principle attention is
1:16:08
much more General than that so for example an encoder decoder Transformers uh you can have a case where the queries
1:16:15
are produced from X but the keys and the values come from a whole separate external source and sometimes from uh
1:16:21
encoder blocks that encode some context that we'd like to condition on and so the keys and the values will
1:16:26
actually come from a whole separate Source those are nodes on the side and here we're just producing queries and
1:16:32
we're reading off information from the side so cross attention is used when there's a separate source of nodes we'd
1:16:40
like to pull information from into our nodes and it's self attention if we just have nodes that would like to look at
1:16:46
each other and talk to each other so this attention here happens to be self
1:16:51
attention but in principle um attention is a lot more General okay and the last
note 6: "scaled" self-attention. why divide by sqrt(head_size)
1:16:57
note at this stage is if we come to the attention is all need paper here we've already implemented attention so given
1:17:03
query key and value we've U multiplied the query and a key we've soft maxed it
1:17:09
and then we are aggregating the values there's one more thing that we're missing here which is the dividing by one / square root of the head size the
1:17:16
DK here is the head size why are they doing this finds this important so they call it the scaled attention and it's
1:17:24
kind of like an important normalization to basically have the problem is if you have unit gsh
1:17:29
and inputs so zero mean unit variance K and Q are unit gashin then if you just do we naively then you see that your we
1:17:37
actually will be uh the variance will be on the order of head size which in our case is 16 but if you multiply by one
1:17:43
over head size square root so this is square root and this is one over then the variance of we will be one
1:17:50
so it will be preserved now why is this important you'll not notice that way
1:17:56
here will feed into softmax and so it's really important especially at initialization that we be
1:18:03
fairly diffuse so in our case here we sort of locked out here and we had a
1:18:10
fairly diffuse numbers here so um like this now the problem is that because of
1:18:15
softmax if weight takes on very positive and very negative numbers inside it softmax will actually converge towards
1:18:22
one hot vectors and so I can illustrate that here um say we are applying softmax
1:18:29
to a tensor of values that are very close to zero then we're going to get a diffuse thing out of softmax but the moment I take the exact
1:18:36
same thing and I start sharpening it making it bigger by multiplying these numbers by eight for example you'll see
1:18:42
that the softmax will start to sharpen and in fact it will sharpen towards the max so it will sharpen towards whatever
1:18:48
number here is the highest and so um basically we don't want these values to be too extreme especially at
1:18:53
initialization otherwise softmax will be way too peaky and um you're basically aggregating um information from like a
1:19:01
single node every node just agregates information from a single other node that's not what we want especially at
1:19:06
initialization and so the scaling is used just to control the variance at initialization okay so having said all
inserting a single self-attention block to our network
1:19:13
that let's now take our self attention knowledge and let's uh take it for a spin so here in the code I created this
1:19:19
head module and it implements a single head of self attention so you give it a head size and then here it creates the
1:19:26
key query and the value linear layers typically people don't use biases in these uh so those are the linear
1:19:33
projections that we're going to apply to all of our nodes now here I'm creating this Trill variable Trill is not a
1:19:40
parameter of the module so in sort of pytorch naming conventions uh this is called a buffer it's not a parameter and
1:19:46
you have to call it you have to assign it to the module using a register buffer so that creates the trill uh the triang
1:19:52
lower triangular Matrix and we're given the input X this should look very familiar now we calculate the keys the
1:19:58
queries we C calculate the attention scores inside way uh we normalize it so
1:20:03
we're using scaled attention here then we make sure that uh future doesn't communicate with the past so this makes
1:20:10
it a decoder block and then softmax and then aggregate the value and
1:20:15
output then here in the language model I'm creating a head in the Constructor and I'm calling it self attention head
1:20:22
and the head size I'm going to keep as the same and embed just for
1:20:27
now and then here once we've encoded the information with the token embeddings
1:20:32
and the position embeddings we're simply going to feed it into the self attention head and then the output of that is
1:20:38
going to go into uh the decoder language modeling head and create the logits so
1:20:44
this the sort of the simplest way to plug in a self attention component uh into our Network right now I had to make
1:20:51
one more change which is that here in the generate uh we have to make sure
1:20:57
that our idx that we feed into the model because now we're using positional embeddings we can never have more than
1:21:04
block size coming in because if idx is more than block size then our position
1:21:09
embedding table is going to run out of scope because it only has embeddings for up to block size and so therefore I
1:21:15
added some uh code here to crop the context that we're going to feed into
1:21:20
self um so that uh we never pass in more than block siiz elements
1:21:25
so those are the changes and let's Now train the network okay so I also came up to the script here and I decreased the
1:21:30
learning rate because uh the self attention can't tolerate very very high learning rates and then I also increased
1:21:36
number of iterations because the learning rate is lower and then I trained it and previously we were only able to get to up to 2.5 and now we are
1:21:43
down to 2.4 so we definitely see a little bit of an improvement from 2.5 to 2.4 roughly uh but the text is still not
1:21:51
amazing so clearly the self attention head is doing some useful communication
1:21:56
but um we still have a long way to go okay so now we've implemented the scale. product attention now next up and the
multi-headed self-attention
1:22:02
attention is all you need paper there's something called multi-head attention and what is multi-head attention it's
1:22:09
just applying multiple attentions in parallel and concatenating their results so they have a little bit of diagram
1:22:15
here I don't know if this is super clear it's really just multiple attentions in
1:22:20
parallel so let's Implement that fairly straightforward if we want a multi-head attention then
1:22:27
we want multiple heads of self attention running in parallel so in pytorch we can
1:22:32
do this by simply creating multiple heads so however heads how however many
1:22:38
heads you want and then what is the head size of each and then we run all of them
1:22:43
in parallel into a list and simply concatenate all of the outputs and we're
1:22:48
concatenating over the channel Dimension so the way this looks now is we don't have just a single ATT
1:22:56
that uh has a hit size of 32 because remember n Ed is 32 instead of having one Communication
1:23:03
channel we now have four communication channels in parallel and each one of these communication channels typically
1:23:10
will be uh smaller uh correspondingly so because we have four communication
1:23:15
channels we want eight dimensional self attention and so from each Communication channel we're going to together eight
1:23:22
dimensional vectors and then we have four of them and that concatenates to give us 32 which is the original and
1:23:28
embed and so this is kind of similar to um if you're familiar with convolutions this is kind of like a group convolution
1:23:34
uh because basically instead of having one large convolution we do convolution in groups and uh that's multi-headed
1:23:40
self attention and so then here we just use essay heads self attention heads instead
1:23:47
now I actually ran it and uh scrolling down I ran the same thing and then we
1:23:53
now get this down to 2.28 roughly and the output is still the generation is
1:23:58
still not amazing but clearly the validation loss is improving because we were at 2.4 just now and so it helps to
1:24:05
have multiple communication channels because obviously these tokens have a lot to talk about they want to find the
1:24:11
consonants the vowels they want to find the vowels just from certain positions uh they want to find any kinds of
1:24:17
different things and so it helps to create multiple independent channels of communication gather lots of different
1:24:22
types of data and then uh decode the output now going back to the paper for a second of course I didn't explain this
feedforward layers of transformer block
1:24:28
figure in full detail but we are starting to see some components of what we've already implemented we have the positional encodings the token encodings
1:24:35
that add we have the masked multi-headed attention implemented now here's another
1:24:41
multi-headed attention which is a cross attention to an encoder which we haven't we're not going to implement in this
1:24:46
case I'm going to come back to that later but I want you to notice that there's a feed forward part here and
1:24:52
then this is grouped into a block that gets repeat it again and again now the feedforward part here is just a simple
1:24:57
uh multi-layer perceptron um so the multi-headed so here position
1:25:04
wise feed forward networks is just a simple little MLP so I want to start basically in a similar fashion also
1:25:10
adding computation into the network and this computation is on a per node level
1:25:16
so I've already implemented it and you can see the diff highlighted on the left here when I've added or changed things
1:25:22
now before we had the self multi-headed self attention that did the communication but we went way too fast
1:25:28
to calculate the logits so the tokens looked at each other but didn't really have a lot of time to think on what they
1:25:35
found from the other tokens and so what I've implemented here is a little feet
1:25:40
forward single layer and this little layer is just a linear followed by a Rel nonlinearity and that's that's it so
1:25:48
it's just a little layer and then I call it feed forward um and embed
1:25:54
and then this feed forward is just called sequentially right after the self attention so we self attend then we feed
1:26:01
forward and you'll notice that the feet forward here when it's applying linear this is on a per token level all the
1:26:06
tokens do this independently so the self attention is the communication and then once they've gathered all the data now
1:26:13
they need to think on that data individually and so that's what feed forward is doing and that's why I've
1:26:18
added it here now when I train this the validation LW actually continues to go down now to 2. 24 which is down from
1:26:26
2.28 uh the output still look kind of terrible but at least we've improved the situation and so as a preview we're
1:26:34
going to now start to intersperse the communication with the computation and
1:26:39
that's also what the Transformer does when it has blocks that communicate and then compute and it groups them and
1:26:46
replicates them okay so let me show you what we'd like to do we'd like to do
residual connections
1:26:51
something like this we have a block and this block is is basically this part here except for the cross
1:26:57
attention now the block basically intersperses communication and then computation the computation the
1:27:03
communication is done using multi-headed selfelf attention and then the computation is done using a feed forward
1:27:08
Network on all the tokens independently now what I've added here
1:27:14
also is you'll notice this takes the number of embeddings in the embedding Dimension
1:27:19
and number of heads that we would like which is kind of like group size in group convolution and and I'm saying
1:27:24
that number of heads we'd like is four and so because this is 32 we calculate that because this is 32 the number of
1:27:31
heads should be four um the head size should be eight so that everything sort
1:27:36
of works out Channel wise um so this is how the Transformer structures uh sort of the uh the sizes typically so the
1:27:44
head size will become eight and then this is how we want to intersperse them and then here I'm trying to create
1:27:49
blocks which is just a sequential application of block block block so that we're interspersing communication feed
1:27:55
forward many many times and then finally we decode now I actually tried to run
1:28:01
this and the problem is this doesn't actually give a very good uh answer and very good result and the reason for that
1:28:07
is we're start starting to actually get like a pretty deep neural net and deep neural Nets uh suffer from optimization
1:28:13
issues and I think that's what we're kind of like slightly starting to run into so we need one more idea that we can borrow from the um Transformer paper
1:28:21
to resolve those difficulties now there are two optimizations that dramatically help with the depth of these networks
1:28:27
and make sure that the networks remain optimizable let's talk about the first one the first one in this diagram is you
1:28:33
see this Arrow here and then this arrow and this Arrow those are skip connections or sometimes called residual
1:28:40
connections they come from this paper uh the presidual learning for image recognition from about
1:28:46
2015 uh that introduced the concept now these are basically what it means is you
1:28:53
transform data but then you have a skip connection with addition from the previous features now the way I like to
1:29:00
visualize it uh that I prefer is the following here the computation happens
1:29:05
from the top to bottom and basically you have this uh residual pathway and you
1:29:11
are free to Fork off from the residual pathway perform some computation and then project back to the residual
1:29:16
pathway via addition and so you go from the the uh inputs to the targets only
1:29:22
via plus and plus plus and the reason this is useful is because during back propagation remember from our microG
1:29:29
grad video earlier addition distributes gradients equally to both of its branches that that fed as the input and
1:29:37
so the supervision or the gradients from the loss basically hop through every
1:29:43
addition node all the way to the input and then also Fork off into the residual
1:29:50
blocks but basically you have this gradient Super Highway that goes directly from the supervision all the
1:29:55
way to the input unimpeded and then these viral blocks are usually initialized in the beginning so they
1:30:01
contribute very very little if anything to the residual pathway they they are initialized that way so in the beginning
1:30:07
they are sort of almost kind of like not there but then during the optimization they come online over time and they uh
1:30:14
start to contribute but at least at the initialization you can go from directly supervision to the input gradient is
1:30:21
unimpeded and just flows and then the blocks over time kick in and so that dramatically helps
1:30:27
with the optimization so let's implement this so coming back to our block here basically what we want to do is we want
1:30:33
to do xal X+ self attention and xal X+ self. feed
1:30:39
forward so this is X and then we Fork off and do some communication and come
1:30:45
back and we Fork off and we do some computation and come back so those are residual connections and then swinging
1:30:51
back up here we also have to introd use this projection so nn.
1:30:57
linear and uh this is going to be from after we concatenate this this is
1:31:03
the prze and embed so this is the output of the self tension itself but then we
1:31:08
actually want the uh to apply the projection and that's the result so the projection is just a
1:31:15
linear transformation of the outcome of this layer so that's the projection back into the virual pathway and then here in a
1:31:22
feet forward it's going to be the same same thing I could have a a self doot projection here as well but let me just
1:31:28
simplify it and let me uh couple it inside the same sequential container and
1:31:34
so this is the projection layer going back into the residual pathway and
1:31:40
so that's uh well that's it so now we can train this so I implemented one more small change when you look into the
1:31:47
paper again you see that the dimensionality of input and output is 512 for them and they're saying that the
1:31:53
inner layer here in the feet forward has dimensionality of 248 so there's a multiplier of four and so the inner
1:32:00
layer of the feet forward Network should be multiplied by four in terms of Channel sizes so I came here and I
1:32:06
multiplied four times embed here for the feed forward and then from four times nmed coming back down to nmed when we go
1:32:13
back to the pro uh to the projection so adding a bit of computation here and growing that layer that is in the
1:32:19
residual block on the side of the residual pathway and then I train this and we
1:32:24
actually get down all the way to uh 2.08 validation loss and we also see that network is starting to get big enough
1:32:30
that our train loss is getting ahead of validation loss so we're starting to see like a little bit of overfitting and um our our
1:32:38
um uh Generations here are still not amazing but at least you see that we can see like is here this now grief syn like
1:32:46
this starts to almost look like English so um yeah we're starting to really get there okay and the second Innovation
layernorm (and its relationship to our previous batchnorm)
1:32:52
that is very helpful for optimizing very deep neural networks is right here so we have this addition now that's the
1:32:58
residual part but this Norm is referring to something called layer Norm so layer Norm is implemented in pytorch it's a
1:33:04
paper that came out a while back here um and layer Norm is very very similar
1:33:11
to bash Norm so remember back to our make more series part three we implemented bash
1:33:17
normalization and uh bash normalization basically just made sure that um Across
1:33:22
The Bash dimension any individual neuron had unit uh Gan um distribution so it
1:33:30
was zero mean and unit standard deviation one standard deviation output
1:33:35
so what I did here is I'm copy pasting the bashor 1D that we developed in our make more series and see here we can
1:33:42
initialize for example this module and we can have a batch of 32 100 dimensional vectors feeding through the
1:33:48
bachor layer so what this does is it guarantees that when we look at just the
1:33:54
zeroth column it's a zero mean one standard deviation so it's normalizing
1:34:00
every single column of this uh input now the rows are not uh going to be
1:34:06
normalized by default because we're just normalizing columns so let's now Implement layer Norm uh it's very
1:34:12
complicated look we come here we change this from zero to one so we don't
1:34:18
normalize The Columns we normalize the rows and now we've implemented layer
1:34:23
Norm so now the columns are not going to be normalized um but the rows are going to
1:34:31
be normalized for every individual example it's 100 dimensional Vector is normalized uh in this way and because
1:34:38
our computation Now does not span across examples we can delete all of this
1:34:43
buffers stuff uh because uh we can always apply this operation and don't
1:34:48
need to maintain any running buffers so we don't need the buffers uh we
1:34:54
don't There's no distinction between training and test time uh and we don't need these running
1:35:00
buffers we do keep gamma and beta we don't need the momentum we don't care if it's training or not and this is now a
1:35:08
layer norm and it normalizes the rows instead of the columns and this here is
1:35:15
identical to basically this here so let's now Implement layer Norm in our
1:35:21
Transformer before I incorporate the layer Norm I just wanted to note that as I said very few details about the
1:35:27
Transformer have changed in the last 5 years but this is actually something that slightly departs from the original paper you see that the ADD and Norm is
1:35:34
applied after the transformation but um in now it is a bit
1:35:40
more uh basically common to apply the layer Norm before the transformation so there's a reshuffling of the layer Norms
1:35:46
uh so this is called the prorm formulation and that's the one that we're going to implement as well so select deviation from the original paper
1:35:53
basically we need two layer Norms layer Norm one is uh NN do layer norm and we
1:35:59
tell it how many um what is the embedding Dimension and we need the second layer norm and then here the
1:36:06
layer Norms are applied immediately on X so self. layer Norm one applied on X and
1:36:13
self. layer Norm two applied on X before it goes into self attention and feed
1:36:18
forward and uh the size of the layer Norm here is an ed so 32 so when the
1:36:23
layer Norm is normalizing our features it is uh the normalization here uh
1:36:30
happens the mean and the variance are taken over 32 numbers so the batch and the time act as batch Dimensions both of
1:36:37
them so this is kind of like a per token um transformation that just normalizes
1:36:42
the features and makes them a unit mean uh unit Gan at
1:36:48
initialization but of course because these layer Norms inside it have these gamma and beta training
1:36:54
parameters uh the layer Norm will U eventually create outputs that might not
1:36:59
be unit gion but the optimization will determine that so for now this is the uh
1:37:05
this is incorporating the layer norms and let's train them on okay so I let it run and we see that we get down to 2.06
1:37:12
which is better than the previous 2.08 so a slight Improvement by adding the layer norms and I'd expect that they
1:37:17
help uh even more if we had bigger and deeper Network one more thing I forgot to add is that there should be a layer
1:37:23
Norm here also typically as at the end of the Transformer and right before the
1:37:28
final uh linear layer that decodes into vocabulary so I added that as well so at
1:37:35
this stage we actually have a pretty complete uh Transformer according to the original paper and it's a decoder only
1:37:40
Transformer I'll I'll talk about that in a second uh but at this stage uh the major pieces are in place so we can try
1:37:46
to scale this up and see how well we can push this number now in order to scale out the model I had to perform some
scaling up the model! creating a few variables. adding dropout
1:37:51
cosmetic changes here to make it nicer so I introduced this variable called n layer which just specifies how many
1:37:57
layers of the blocks we're going to have I created a bunch of blocks and we have a new variable number of heads as well I
1:38:05
pulled out the layer Norm here and uh so this is identical now one thing that I did briefly change is I added a Dropout
1:38:13
so Dropout is something that you can add right before the residual connection back right before the connection back
1:38:19
into the residual pathway so we can drop out that as l layer here we can drop out
1:38:26
uh here at the end of the multi-headed exension as well and we can also drop out here uh when we calculate the um
1:38:34
basically affinities and after the softmax we can drop out some of those so we can randomly prevent some of the
1:38:40
nodes from communicating and so Dropout uh comes from this paper from 2014 or so and
1:38:49
basically it takes your neural nut and it randomly every forward backward pass shuts off some subset of
1:38:56
uh neurons so randomly drops them to zero and trains without them and what
1:39:02
this does effectively is because the mask of what's being dropped out is changed every single forward backward
1:39:07
pass it ends up kind of uh training an ensemble of sub networks and then at
1:39:13
test time everything is fully enabled and kind of all of those sub networks are merged into a single Ensemble if you
1:39:18
can if you want to think about it that way so I would read the paper to get the full detail for now we're just going to
1:39:24
stay on the level of this is a regularization technique and I added it because I'm about to scale up the model
1:39:30
quite a bit and I was concerned about overfitting so now when we scroll up to the top uh we'll see that I changed a
1:39:36
number of hyper parameters here about our neural nut so I made the batch size be much larger now it's 64 I changed the
1:39:43
block size to be 256 so previously it was just eight eight characters of context now it is 256 characters of
1:39:50
context to predict the 257th uh I brought down the learning rate a
1:39:55
little bit because the neural net is now much bigger so I brought down the learning rate the embedding Dimension is
1:40:01
now 384 and there are six heads so 384 divide 6 means that every head is 64
1:40:08
dimensional as it as a standard and then there's going to be six layers of that
1:40:13
and the Dropout will be at 02 so every forward backward pass 20% of all of these um intermediate calculations are
1:40:21
disabled and dropped to zero and then I already trained this and I ran it so uh drum roll how well does it
1:40:28
perform so let me just scroll up here we get a validation loss of
1:40:34
1.48 which is actually quite a bit of an improvement on what we had before which I think was 2.07 so it went from 2.07
1:40:41
all the way down to 1.48 just by scaling up this neural nut with the code that we have and this of course ran for a lot
1:40:47
longer this maybe trained for I want to say about 15 minutes on my a100 GPU so
1:40:52
that's a pretty a GPU and if you don't have a GPU you're not going to be able to reproduce this uh on a CPU this would
1:40:59
be um I would not run this on a CPU or MacBook or something like that you'll have to Brak down the number of uh
1:41:04
layers and the embedding Dimension and so on uh but in about 15 minutes we can get this kind of a result and um I'm
1:41:12
printing some of the Shakespeare here but what I did also is I printed 10,000 characters so a lot more and I wrote
1:41:18
them to a file and so here we see some of the outputs
1:41:24
so it's a lot more recognizable as the input text file so the input text file just for reference looked like this so
1:41:31
there's always like someone speaking in this manner and uh our predictions now
1:41:37
take on that form except of course they're they're nonsensical when you actually read them
1:41:43
so it is every crimp tap be a house oh those
1:41:48
prepation we give heed um you know
1:41:56
Oho sent me you mighty Lord anyway so you can read through this
1:42:02
um it's nonsensical of course but this is just a Transformer trained on a character level for 1 million characters
1:42:09
that come from Shakespeare so there's sort of like blabbers on in Shakespeare like manner but it doesn't of course
1:42:14
make sense at this scale uh but I think I think still a pretty good demonstration of what's
1:42:20
possible so now I think uh that kind of like concludes
1:42:26
the programming section of this video we basically kind of uh did a pretty good job and um of implementing this
1:42:32
Transformer uh but the picture doesn't exactly match up to what we've done so what's going on with all these digital
1:42:38
Parts here so let me finish explaining this architecture and why it looks so funky basically what's happening here is
encoder vs. decoder vs. both (?) Transformers
1:42:45
what we implemented here is a decoder only Transformer so there's no component here this part is called the encoder and
1:42:52
there's no cross attention block here our block only has a self attention and
1:42:58
the feet forward so it is missing this third in between piece here this piece
1:43:03
does cross attention so we don't have it and we don't have the encoder we just have the decoder and the reason we have
1:43:08
a decoder only uh is because we are just uh generating text and it's unconditioned on anything we're just
1:43:15
we're just blabbering on according to a given data set what makes it a decoder is that we are using the Triangular mask
1:43:21
in our uh trans former so it has this Auto regressive property where we can just uh go and sample from it so the
1:43:28
fact that it's using the Triangular triangular mask to mask out the attention makes it a decoder and it can
1:43:34
be used for language modeling now the reason that the original paper had an incoder decoder architecture is because
1:43:41
it is a machine translation paper so it is concerned with a different setting in particular it expects some uh tokens
1:43:49
that encode say for example French and then it is expecting to decode the translation in English so so you
1:43:56
typically these here are special tokens so you are expected to read in this and
1:44:02
condition on it and then you start off the generation with a special token called start so this is a special new
1:44:08
token um that you introduce and always place in the beginning and then the network is expected to Output neural
1:44:15
networks are awesome and then a special end token to finish the generation so this part here will be
1:44:23
decoded exactly as we we've done it neural networks are awesome will be identical to what we did but unlike what
1:44:29
we did they wanton to condition the generation on some additional information and in that case this
1:44:36
additional information is the French sentence that they should be translating so what they do now is they
1:44:42
bring in the encoder now the encoder reads this part here so we're only going
1:44:48
to take the part of French and we're going to uh create tokens from it exactly as we've seen in our video and
1:44:54
we're going to put a Transformer on it but there's going to be no triangular mask and so all the tokens are allowed
1:45:00
to talk to each other as much as they want and they're just encoding whatever's the content of this French uh
1:45:07
sentence once they've encoded it they they basically come out in the top here
1:45:13
and then what happens here is in our decoder which does the uh language modeling there's an additional
1:45:20
connection here to the outputs of the encoder and that is brought in through a cross
1:45:26
attention so the queries are still generated from X but now the keys and the values are coming from the side the
1:45:32
keys and the values are coming from the top generated by the nodes that came outside of the de the encoder and those
1:45:40
tops the keys and the values there the top of it feed in on a side into every
1:45:45
single block of the decoder and so that's why there's an additional cross attention and really what it's doing is
1:45:51
it's conditioning the decoding not just on the past of this current decoding but also on having seen the
1:45:59
full fully encoded French um prompt sort of and so it's an encoder decoder model
1:46:06
which is why we have those two Transformers an additional block and so on so we did not do this because we have
1:46:12
no we have nothing to encode there's no conditioning we just have a text file and we just want to imitate it and that's why we are using a decoder only
1:46:19
Transformer exactly as done in GPT okay okay so now I wanted to do a
super quick walkthrough of nanoGPT, batched multi-headed self-attention
1:46:24
very brief walkthrough of nanog GPT which you can find in my GitHub and uh nanog GPT is basically two files of
1:46:30
Interest there's train.py and model.py train.py is all the boilerplate code for
1:46:35
training the network it is basically all the stuff that we had here it's the training loop it's just that it's a lot
1:46:42
more complicated because we're saving and loading checkpoints and pre-trained weights and we are uh decaying the
1:46:48
learning rate and compiling the model and using distributed training across multiple nodes or GP use so the training
1:46:54
Pi gets a little bit more hairy complicated uh there's more options Etc
1:46:59
but the model.py should look very very um similar to what we've done here in fact the model is is almost identical so
1:47:08
first here we have the causal self attention block and all of this should look very very recognizable to you we're
1:47:13
producing queries Keys values we're doing Dot products we're masking applying soft Maxs optionally dropping
1:47:20
out and here we are pulling the wi the values what is different here is that in
1:47:25
our code I have separated out the multi-headed detention into just a
1:47:31
single individual head and then here I have multiple heads and I explicitly concatenate them whereas here uh all of
1:47:39
it is implemented in a batched manner inside a single causal self attention and so we don't just have a b and a T
1:47:45
and A C Dimension we also end up with a fourth dimension which is the heads and so it just gets a lot more sort of hairy
1:47:52
because we have four dimensional array um tensors now but it is um equivalent
1:47:57
mathematically so the exact same thing is happening as what we have it's just it's a bit more efficient because all
1:48:02
the heads are now treated as a batch Dimension as well then we have the multier perceptron
1:48:08
it's using the Galu nonlinearity which is defined here except instead of Ru and
1:48:13
this is done just because opening I used it and I want to be able to load their checkpoints uh the blocks of the
1:48:19
Transformer are identical to communicate in the compute phase as we saw and then the GPT will be identical we have the
1:48:25
position encodings token encodings the blocks the layer Norm at the end uh the
1:48:30
final linear layer and this should look all very recognizable and there's a bit
1:48:35
more here because I'm loading checkpoints and stuff like that I'm separating out the parameters into those that should be weight decayed and those
1:48:42
that shouldn't um but the generate function should also be very very similar so a
1:48:47
few details are different but you should definitely be able to look at this uh file and be able to understand little
1:48:52
the pieces now so let's now bring things back to chat GPT what would it look like if we wanted to train chat GPT ourselves
back to ChatGPT, GPT-3, pretraining vs. finetuning, RLHF
1:48:59
and how does it relate to what we learned today well to train in chat GPT there are roughly two stages first is
1:49:05
the pre-training stage and then the fine-tuning stage in the pre-training stage uh we are training on a large
1:49:12
chunk of internet and just trying to get a first decoder only Transformer to
1:49:17
babble text so it's very very similar to what we've done ourselves except we've
1:49:23
done like a tiny little baby pre-training step um and so in our case
1:49:28
uh this is how you print a number of parameters I printed it and it's about 10 million so this Transformer that I
1:49:35
created here to create little Shakespeare um Transformer was about 10
1:49:40
million parameters our data set is roughly 1 million uh characters so roughly 1 million tokens but you have to
1:49:47
remember that opening I is different vocabulary they're not on the Character level they use these um subword chunks
1:49:53
of words and so they have a vocabulary of 50,000 roughly elements and so their sequences are a bit more condensed so
1:50:01
our data set the Shakespeare data set would be probably around 300,000 uh tokens in the open AI vocabulary roughly
1:50:09
so we trained about 10 million parameter model on roughly 300,000 tokens now when
1:50:14
you go to the gpt3 paper and you look at the Transformers
1:50:20
that they trained they trained a number of trans Transformers of different sizes but the biggest Transformer here has 175
1:50:27
billion parameters uh so ours is again 10 million they used this number of layers in the Transformer this is the
1:50:34
nmed this is the number of heads and this is the head size and then this is
1:50:39
the batch size uh so ours was 65 and the learning rate is similar now
1:50:46
when they train this Transformer they trained on 300 billion tokens so again remember ours is about 300,000
1:50:53
so this is uh about a millionfold increase and this number would not be even that large by today's standards
1:50:59
you'd be going up uh 1 trillion and above so they are training a
1:51:04
significantly larger model on uh a good chunk of the internet
1:51:10
and that is the pre-training stage but otherwise these hyper parameters should be fairly recognizable to you and the
1:51:15
architecture is actually like nearly identical to what we implemented ourselves but of course it's a massive
1:51:20
infrastructure challenge to train this you're talking about typically thousands of gpus having to you know talk to each
1:51:27
other to train models of this size so that's just a pre-training stage now after you complete the pre-training
1:51:33
stage uh you don't get something that responds to your questions with answers and is not helpful and Etc you get a
1:51:40
document completer right so it babbles but it doesn't Babble Shakespeare it babbles
1:51:46
internet it will create arbitrary news articles and documents and it will try to complete documents because that's
1:51:51
what it's trained for it's trying to complete the sequence so when you give it a question it would just uh potentially just give you more questions
1:51:58
it would follow with more questions it will do whatever it looks like the some close document would do in the training
1:52:05
data on the internet and so who knows you're getting kind of like undefined Behavior it might basically answer with
1:52:11
to questions with other questions it might ignore your question it might just try to complete some news article it's
1:52:17
totally unineed as we say so the second fine-tuning stage is to actually align
1:52:22
it to be an assistant and uh this is the second stage and so this chat GPT block
1:52:28
post from openi talks a little bit about how the stage is achieved we basically
1:52:34
um there's roughly three steps to to this stage uh so what they do here is they start to collect training data that
1:52:41
looks specifically like what an assistant would do so these are documents that have to format where the question is on top and then an answer is
1:52:47
below and they have a large number of these but probably not on the order of the internet uh this is probably on the
1:52:53
of maybe thousands of examples and so they they then fine-tune the model to
1:53:00
basically only focus on documents that look like that and so you're starting to slowly align it so it's going to expect
1:53:07
a question at the top and it's going to expect to complete the answer and uh these very very large models are very
1:53:13
sample efficient during their fine-tuning so this actually somehow works but that's just step one that's
1:53:19
just fine tuning so then they actually have more steps where okay the second step is you let the model respond and
1:53:25
then different Raiders look at the different responses and rank them for their preference as to which one is
1:53:30
better than the other they use that to train a reward model so they can predict uh basically using a different network
1:53:37
how much of any candidate response would be desirable and then
1:53:43
once they have a reward model they run po which is a form of polic policy gradient um reinforcement learning
1:53:49
Optimizer to uh fine-tune this sampling policy uh so that the answers that the
1:53:55
GP chat GPT now generates are expected to score a high reward according to the
1:54:02
reward model and so basically there's a whole aligning stage here or fine-tuning stage it's got multiple steps in between
1:54:09
there as well and it takes the model from being a document completer to a
1:54:14
question answerer and that's like a whole separate stage a lot of this data is not available publicly it is internal
1:54:21
to open AI and uh it's much harder to replicate this stage um and so that's
1:54:27
roughly what would give you a chat GPT and nanog GPT focuses on the pre-training stage okay and that's
conclusions
1:54:32
everything that I wanted to cover today so we trained to summarize a decoder
1:54:38
only Transformer following this famous paper attention is all you need from
1:54:43
2017 and so that's basically a GPT we trained it on Tiny Shakespeare and got
1:54:50
sensible results all of the training code is roughly 200 lines of code I will be
1:54:57
releasing this um code base so also it comes with all the git log commits along
1:55:04
the way as we built it up in addition to this code I'm going to release the um notebook of course the
1:55:10
Google collab and I hope that gave you a sense for how you can train um these
1:55:16
models like say gpt3 that will be um architecturally basically identical to what we have but they are somewhere
1:55:22
between 10,000 and 1 million times bigger depending on how you count and so
1:55:27
uh that's all I have for now uh we did not talk about any of the fine-tuning stages that would typically go on top of
1:55:33
this so if you're interested in something that's not just language modeling but you actually want to you know say perform tasks um or you want
1:55:40
them to be aligned in a specific way or you want um to detect sentiment or anything like that basically anytime you
1:55:47
don't want something that's just a document completer you have to complete further stages of fine tuning which did
1:55:52
not cover uh and that could be simple supervised fine tuning or it can be something more fancy like we see in chat
1:55:58
jpt where we actually train a reward model and then do rounds of Po to uh align it with respect to the reward
1:56:04
model so there's a lot more that can be done on top of it I think for now we're starting to get to about two hours Mark
1:56:10
uh so I'm going to um kind of finish here uh I hope you enjoyed the lecture
1:56:15
uh and uh yeah go forth and transform see you later
